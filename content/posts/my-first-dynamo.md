Every Revit user has a story on how they got hooked with Dynamo. Mine is a simple one - string manipulation to rename views. Since we have our own naming conventions per cardinal direction, we had to rename all of the views generated by Revit

### UI First (most of the time)

Not all Dynamo scripts require UI interaction but in this case, I do need the user to choose which elevation names they intend to regenerate. UI form is really easy to prop up with packages like Data-Shapes.
